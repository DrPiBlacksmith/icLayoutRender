Havin a high quality layout image for publishing is a painfull process. And usually published layouts have poor quality.

This library intends to make this process as straight forward as possible. By inputing a .gds file the script outputs a .tex and a pdf file ready for publication.



## API Reference

### Generating a GDS File on CADENCE Virtuoso 

Open the Virtuoso Window, and go to File->Export->Stream

Configure the stream file to be: cellName.gds

Select your library and the topcell to be exported
  - Library: Mylib
  - Cell: cellName
  - View: Layout

Click **Apply**

### LayerColor File

The LayerColors.map file is created for a specific Process Design Kit (PDK)

If the available PDK has the layers:
- diffusion is lime,
- poly-Si is red, 
- n-type implantation is gold, 
- p-type implantation is pink...

File format is:

- GDSNumber!Layer!Collor
- 4!DIFF!{rgb:red,0;green,255;blue,0}
- 5!POLY!{rgb:red,255;green,0;blue,0}
- 6!NIMP!{rgb:red,217;green,204;blue,0}
- 7!PIMP!{rgb:red,255;green,191;blue,242}

### Creating LayerColors file

Obtain the GDS layer number using 
  > Technology Tool Box->Manager->Dumpâ€¦->Save

The layer numbers can also be obtained when exporting the .gds file as shown on the image bellow:
![](/Images/LayerNumbers.png)


Obtain the colors from Virtuoso layout using
  > Display Resources Tool Box->Edit->File->Save
![](/Images/LayerColors.png)

Compare the *.tf file and the *.drf

Write a new layerColors_PDK.map according to the example

Missing layers will be neglected

```bash
  python gds2pdf
  Please enter the cell name: **INPUT FILE** # No GDS extention
  Please enter the layer colors: **LayerColor** # No CSV extention
```
